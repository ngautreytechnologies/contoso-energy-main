  "title": "Contoso Energy - Unobtrusive AI Integration in Serverless Event-Driven Architecture",
  "overview": "An enterprise-grade event-driven platform that layers machine learning and intelligent enrichment invisibly into existing energy data workflows — without disrupting operations or requiring application rewrites.",
  "keyFeatures": [
    "IoT ingestion via API Gateway and Kinesis",
    "C# microservice with KCL for stream processing",
    "Python AI sidecar for transparent ML enrichment",
    "DynamoDB for enriched operational state",
    "S3 for historical telemetry and feature stores",
    "EventBridge for decoupled orchestration",
    "Analytics layer powered by Athena, Redshift, QuickSight"
  ],
  "pros": "Seamlessly integrates AI into existing pipelines without code changes; Highly scalable serverless architecture with reduced operational overhead; Real-time inference and anomaly detection with minimal latency impact; Modular and extensible design using sidecar and decorator patterns; Dramatically reduces time-to-insight while lowering infrastructure costs.",
  "cons": "Integrating AI without modifying legacy ingestion or storage systems; Maintaining latency SLAs while performing inference at scale; Ensuring explainability and traceability for enriched data; Supporting incremental rollout with no service downtime",

  "problem": "Large energy companies struggle to embed AI into existing data pipelines without costly re-engineering. Many existing systems cannot tolerate downtime or major refactors, yet real-time intelligence is needed for anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and customer analytics.",
  "solution": "Designed a serverless, event-driven backbone that injects AI into the data lifecycle as an enrichment layer — deployed alongside existing microservices without changing upstream producers or downstream consumers. IoT telemetry streams into Kinesis and is processed by a C# microservice, with a Python ML sidecar performing inference transparently. Results are persisted and orchestrated with EventBridge and Step Functions, feeding analytics layers without disrupting business workflows.",
  "timeline": "2024-02 - 2024-06",
  "impact": {
    "metrics": {
      "processing time reduction": "40% faster compared to legacy batch system",
      "cost savings": "30% lower infrastructure cost due to serverless adoption",
      "transactions processed": "Over 5 million telemetry events daily",
      "integration cost savings": "Zero upstream code changes required for AI integration"
    },
    "business_outcome": "Enabled real-time intelligence across existing energy telemetry pipelines with zero operational disruption, unlocking predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and customer-facing insights."
